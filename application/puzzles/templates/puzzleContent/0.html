<h1> Towers of Hanoi </h1>

<p> 
In this puzzle, there are three rods - A, B and C and n number of disks. 
The puzzle is solved when all n disks are moved from rod A to rod C, with only two rules:

1. Only the top disk on a rod may be moved at a time.  
2. Larger disks may not be placed on top of smaller disks.

Your task is to design an algorithm that solves this puzzle in the minimum number of steps,  
The algorithm must output a list of moves - for example the list [('A', 'B'), ('B', 'C')] 
describes moving the top disk of A to B, and then moving the top disk of B to C.

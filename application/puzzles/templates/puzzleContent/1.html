<h1> Towers of Hanoi </h1>

<p id="puzzleText"> 
In this puzzle, there are three rods - A, B and C and <b>9 disks.</b> </br>
The puzzle is solved when all 9 disks are moved from rod A to rod C, with only two rules:</br></br>

<b>1. Only the top disk on a rod may be moved at a time.  </br></br></br>
2. Larger disks may not be placed on top of smaller disks.</br></br></br></b>

Your task is to design an algorithm that solves this puzzle in the minimum number of steps. </br> </br>
The algorithm must output a list of moves - for example the list [('A', 'B'), ('B', 'C')] </br>
describes moving the top disk of A to B, and then moving the top disk of B to C.</br></br>
